Using raw strings and numbers is discouraged.  Instead, consider using configuration files to define these values. 
You are encouraged to think and act in a Laravel idiomatic way. Use laravel helpers whenever possible for operations such as string manipulation, array manipulation, etc.
You are also encouraged to use Laravel's built-in features and libraries. 
Avoid hardcoded stiring references, instead, use language features to reference symbols, such as constants, enums, or class names.
